# Codedefender-Yara

Yara Rule for the CodeDefender obfuscator. 

Website: https://codedefender.io/

CodeDefender is a next-generation software protector that specializes in binary obfuscation. Codedefender's primary technique is to convert standard operations into SIMD (SSE 4.1/AVX) operations. Codedefender is incredibly effective at confusing decompilers by combining and interleaving large arithmetic operations and utilizing archaic instructions, making static analysis impossible.

Codedefender operates on a business-to-business basis. It's highly unlikely that any Codedefender-protected application is malware.
